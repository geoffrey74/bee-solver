This is a tiny app to solve the New York Times Spelling Bee, kind of. It uses different word lists, which may have fewer or more words than the NYT version.

To use:
- Install via the following commands:
    - 'pip install nltk' to install the Python NTLK wordlist (see https://www.nltk.org/index.html)
    - 'pip install bs4' to install BeautifulSoup4 (see https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- Run 'python solver.py'.
- Enter the letter corresponding to the desired wordlist.
- Enter the OUTER letters first.
- Enter the MIDDLE (required) letter last.

If a better wordlist is found, please let the author know. Enjoy!
